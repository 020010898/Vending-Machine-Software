# Vending-Machine-Software
This program imitates a Vending Machine that takes user input for money, initiates a transaction,
provides a selection of items with a defined quantity, and machine settings options. This program was coded in Java.

The application will receive a JSON file at any given time and will update the functionality of the machine. 
When a consumer enters a selection, it should report what was selected.
